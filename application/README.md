# Application

This directory contains scripts and resources for applying the developed statistical models to real-world datasets. The focus is on demonstrating the practical utility of the models and providing examples of their application.

## Files

- **apply_model.R**: The main script for applying the statistical models to datasets. It includes functions for data preprocessing, model fitting, and result visualization.
- **data_preprocessing.R**: Contains functions for cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **visualization.R**: Provides utilities for visualizing model results, including plots and charts.
- **example_dataset.csv**: A sample dataset used for demonstrating the application of models.

## Usage

1. Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and located in the `application` directory.
2. Modify `apply_model.R` to specify the dataset and model parameters.
3. Run `apply_model.R` using R to apply the model to your dataset.
4. Use `visualization.R` to generate plots and charts of the results.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary R packages installed, such as `ggplot2` for visualization and any other packages required by the specific models you are applying.

## Notes

- The `example_dataset.csv` is provided as a template. Replace it with your own data for analysis.
- Customize the scripts as needed to fit the specific requirements of your dataset and analysis goals.
